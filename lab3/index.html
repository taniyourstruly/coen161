            Javascript by default has a global scope. This means that any variables
            or functions or classes not inside of a function or a block are available
            to all scripts that come after. So Stack from stack.js is available from
            index.js.

            TASK 1F: What does the defer attribute do? Where would we have to put these 
            two statements if we didn't have defer?

            The defer attribute delays running the stack.js and index.js until the very
            end of the html file. We would have to put these two statements after main if
            we didn't have defer.

                This component will act sort of like a grid. You should look at the index.css
                file to see how Flexbox can be used to do this. But CSS grid is a much more
                powerful browser primitive that can accomplish this. We just didn't go over it.
